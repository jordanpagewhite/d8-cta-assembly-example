# UX: Mockup and Data Structure

## Roles

* A UX team member
* There is often benefit in collaborating with a developer at this, albeit early, stage in the process to ensure that UX and developer(s) are on the same page regarding the data structure

## Mockup

Here is an example of the CTA component / a mockup:

![CTA Assembly Type Example](../img/cta-component.png "CTA Assembly Type Example")

## General understanding of data structure

Here is a table that describes the fields / data structure of the CTA assembly type:

![CTA Data Structure](../img/cta-data-structure.png "CTA Data Structure")

This table is just a screenshot of the Drupal CTA assembly type fields. At this stage in the creation of this assembly type, you do not necessarily need to determine exactly what the field type would be in Drupal, but a UX designer would need to be able to communicate to the developer(s) exactly what type(s) of data would be expected in this component, including scenarios like optional data, any conditional functionality, etc. to ensure that all scenarios are accounted for.

## Deliverables

* A mockup (this would typically include various viewports, variants, etc.)
* A clear understanding, between the UX designer(s) and developer(s), of the data structure of this component
